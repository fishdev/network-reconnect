{"name":"Network Reconnect","tagline":"A utility designed to make managing wired and wireless network connections easy","body":"## About\r\n\r\nNetwork Reconnect is a utility designed to make managing wired and wireless network connections easy. It is a set of scripts for Linux operating systems that uses certain built-in technologies to provide basic network connections. The purpose of this is to eliminate overhead present in other utilities and to add extra features that will benefit a vast number of users.\r\n\r\n## History\r\n\r\nI first created network-reconnect when my WiFi card was having issues with dropouts and I needed to refresh the connection every time the link went dead. Eventually, I realized that network-reconnect needed to have some sort of interface so I could connect to different networks. The program soon evolved into what you see today. I've decided to share network-reconnect because:\r\n* many mainstream computers have unreliable network interfaces that could use a simple reconnect script\r\n* other network connection utilities for Linux/UNIX have a lot of unnecessary overhead\r\n\r\n## Installation (not complete)\r\n\r\nSo you've downloaded one of our master packages.\r\n\r\n1. type ```commands```\r\n2. cool stuff\r\n\r\n```\r\nthis \r\nis\r\ncool yes cool\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\n## More Information\r\n\r\nThis software utility is currently in active development, and we do not recommend that you use it in real-world production scenarios. Right now, there are plenty of [issues](https://github.com/fishdev/network-reconnect/issues), so please feel free to [contribute](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) if you want to help us out!\r\n\r\nIf you want to know more about how to install and use network-reconnect, please see our [wiki](https://github.com/fishdev/network-reconnect/wiki).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
