<a name="about" class="anchor" href="#about"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About</h2>

<p>Network Reconnect is a utility designed to make managing wired and wireless network connections easy. It is a set of scripts for Linux operating systems that uses certain built-in technologies to provide basic network connections. The purpose of this is to eliminate overhead present in other utilities and to add extra features that will benefit a vast number of users.</p>

<h2>
<a name="history" class="anchor" href="#history"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>History</h2>

<p>I first created network-reconnect when my WiFi card was having issues with dropouts and I needed to refresh the connection every time the link went dead. Eventually, I realized that network-reconnect needed to have some sort of interface so I could connect to different networks. The program soon evolved into what you see today. I've decided to share network-reconnect because:</p>

<ul>
<li>many mainstream computers have unreliable network interfaces that could use a simple reconnect script</li>
<li>other network connection utilities for Linux/UNIX have a lot of unnecessary overhead</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a name="compatibility" class="anchor" href="#compatibility"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Compatibility</h2>

<p>You might have noticed that we only mentioned Linux in our introduction above. No Windows or Mac? Why, that's insane!</p>

<p>Well, yes, while not supporting the two most popular desktop operating systems might seem a bit foolish, network-reconnect is currently only supported on the Linux platform. That's because our program is written entirely in Shell and depends on GNU/Linux userspace utilities that are hard to port to other platforms. If you are really itching to try out network-reconnect, you could attempt to install Mac equivalents of the required software and force-run our scripts...Sorry Windows people, you're completely out of luck right now. If you want to see network-reconnect grow, we strongly encourage you to <a href="https://github.com/fishdev/network-reconnect/pulls">contribute</a>.</a></p>

<h2>
<a name="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h2>

<p>So you've downloaded one of our master packages. What next? Follow the instructions below on any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution">Linux distribution</a> and you'll be set up within minutes.</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the <code>network-reconnect-master.zip</code> or <code>network-reconnect-master.tar.gz</code> file you downloaded in an archive manager. This should happen by double-clicking on the file.</li>
<li>In the window that opens, navigate to the "Extract" button and click on it. Be sure to remember the location where you extracted the package.</li>
<li>Start a terminal. In <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>, for example, this can be done by pressing <code>Ctrl + Alt + T</code>.
</li>
<li>In the terminal, change the working directory to where you extracted the archive. If you extracted to your Desktop, you would type <code>cd ~/Desktop</code>.
</li>
<li>Launch the network-reconnect installer by using the commands <code>sudo chmod a+x</code> and then <code>./install.sh</code>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Unless you get any red <a href="https://github.com/fishdev/network-reconnect/wiki/Troubleshooting">error messages</a>, you're all done! You can delete the network-reconnect archives and get started with the program.</a></p>

<h2>
<a name="getting-started" class="anchor" href="#getting-started"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting Started</h2>

<p>Really, network-reconnect is quite simple. Basic usage depends solely on the type of network you're trying to connect to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wired (Ethernet)</li>
<li>Wireless (WiFi)</li>
</ul>

<p>For wired networks, make sure that you have an active Ethernet cable plugged into your computer, then follow these instructions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start "Network Reconnect" from your desktop launcher or type <code>network-reconnect-gui</code> in a terminal.
</li>
<li>In the window that opens, select the button for "Connect to a Network" and click "OK".</li>
<li>After a new dialog appears, select the button for "Ethernet" and click "OK". Unless you get any <a href="https://github.com/fishdev/network-reconnect/wiki/Troubleshooting">errors</a>, you're ready to use the Internet!</li>
</ol>

<p>If you want to connect to a wireless network, we have a few things to say beforehand. First of all, make sure that your computer has some sort of WiFi adapter (either through a USB dongle or internally). But please note that, unfortunately, network-reconnect is unable to activate WPA-secured networks at this time. That said, you can connect to any unsecured or WEP network by following these quick steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start "Network Reconnect" from your desktop launcher or type <code>network-reconnect-gui</code> in a terminal.
</li>
<li>In the window that opens, select the button for "Connect to a Network" and click "OK".</li>
<li>After a new dialog appears, select the button for "WiFi" and click "OK".</li>
<li>A list of available networks should appear. If the list is blank, please see <a href="https://github.com/fishdev/network-reconnect/wiki/Troubleshooting">here</a>.</a> In the box under the list, retype the exact name of the network you want to connect to and click "OK". Now you're ready to use the Internet!</li>
</ol>
