network-reconnect-extra
=======================

Network Reconnect is a utility designed to make managing wired and wireless network connections easy. It is a set of scripts for Linux operating systems that uses certain built-in technologies to provide basic network connections. The purpose of this is to eliminate overhead present in other utilities and to add extra features that will benefit a vast number of users.

The network-reconnect-extra branch is a package that provides several advanced features to users who require functionality beyond the scope of what network-reconnect itself is designed to offer. This way, most users can use the streamlined master utility, while power users can utilize this extra branch.

Work on extra will begin after the release [v0.3](https://github.com/fishdev/network-reconnect/issues?milestone=3) of master.

This software utility is currently in active development, and we do not recommend that you use it in real-world production scenarios. Right now, there are plenty of [issues](https://github.com/fishdev/network-reconnect/issues), so please feel free to [contribute](https://github.com/fishdev/network-reconnect/pulls) if you want to help us out!
