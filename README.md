network-reconnect
=================

Network Reconnect is a utility designed to make managing wired and wireless network connections easy. It is a set of scripts for Linux operating systems that uses certain built-in technologies to provide basic network connections. The purpose of this is to eliminate overhead present in other utilities and to add extra features that will benefit a vast number of users.

This software utility is currently in active development, and we do not recommend that you use it in real-world production scenarios. Right now, there are plenty of [issues](https://github.com/fishdev/network-reconnect/issues), so please feel free to [contribute](https://github.com/fishdev/network-reconnect/pulls) if you want to help us out!

### History

I first created network-reconnect when my WiFi card was having issues with dropouts and I needed to refresh the connection every time the link went dead. Eventually, I realized that network-reconnect needed to have some sort of interface so I could connect to different networks. The program soon evolved into what you see today. I've decided to share network-reconnect because:
* many mainstream computers have unreliable network interfaces that could use a simple reconnect script
* other network connection utilities for Linux/UNIX have a lot of unnecessary overhead

<h3>Features</h3>

<p>We currently support a wide range of useful and easy-to-use features that are built right into network-reconnect, with even more cool functionality on the way. Here is a quick breakdown of the most notable features we offer:</p>

<ul>
<li>Two ways to use: GUI and CLI</li>
<li>Management of basic wired and wirelss connections</li>
<li>Simple and advanced report generation</li>
<li>Automatic checking and refreshing of all connections</li>
<li>Instant-on connection upon wakeup and bootup</li>
<li>Extensive backend independent of interfaces</li>
</ul>
